  AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any client-side software for that.
  It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a “black hole”, thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers. It's based on software we use for our public AdGuard DNS servers, and both share a lot of code.

releaseNotes: >-
  As promised in the notes for the previous release, this update brings some quality-of-life improvements as well as a few bug fixes 🔧.

  Full changelog
  * See also the v0.107.46 GitHub milestone.

  Added
  * Ability to disable the use of system hosts file information for query resolution.
  * Ability to define custom directories for storage of query log files and statistics.

  Changed
  * Private rDNS resolution (dns.use_private_ptr_resolvers in YAML configuration) now requires a valid "Private reverse DNS servers", when enabled.
  * Note: Disabling private rDNS resolution behaves effectively the same as if no private reverse DNS servers provided by user and by the OS.

  Fixed
  * Statistics for 7 days displayed by day on the dashboard graph.
  * Missing "served from cache" label on long DNS server strings.
  * Incorrect tracking of the system hosts file's changes.
